\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future_work}

Given the models and results presented in this work, we propose some directions for future work:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{Derive a better comprehensive analysis of cause/effects of the temporal motifs related to the parameters of the simulation. We believe that there must exist a relation and this relation could be beneficial when building a distinct model.}
   
  \item{We suppose that a set of small rules is not enough to capture the whole Bitcoin dynamics. Thus, we believe a mix of generative models could significantly improve the quality of the dynamics.}
  
  \item{Last but not least, we think it is possible to connect the learned $\hat{F}$, provided by the BIGCLAM algorithm, into our generative model as initial values for the Activity firing rates of the nodes. Despite, this connection is not a trivial task, this could bring a promising ability to predict future dynamics of the live Bitcoin Blockchain.}
\end{enumerate}
