    Our motivation in this analysis is that behind the transaction data stored on the Bitcoin Blockchain there is a hidden network which can provide valuable information on how agents made transactions through the usage of Bitcoins. As a consequence, we are interested in performing an analysis on the relationships between Bitcoin addresses. In this section, we introduce a way to translate the Bitcoin transactions into a Graph data structure which takes into consideration the time that the edge were created, and characterize this graph.

\section{Bitcoin as a Graph}
\label{sec:bitcoin_as_a_graph}


<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Our analysis begins by realizing that the Bitcoin transactions can be seen as a Graph. We saw in Section~\ref{subsec:bitcoin_transactions}, that a Bitcoin transaction is a record of input and output addresses. The addresses can be translated into the vertices of our Graph. The transferring of funds from \textit{Address A} to \textit{Address B} is converted to a directed edge from \textit{Address A} to \textit{Address B}. By design, the Bitcoin protocol allows a transaction to have more than one output address. Meaning, a user could transfer to more than one different user on the same transaction. Meaning, the relationship between inputs and outputs of a transaction is \textit{N to M}. For that reason, we can not discover from which input the funds are going exactly to which output. Figure \ref{fig:inputProblem}, visualizes this problem. Thus, we applied the same technique proposed on \cite{networkStructureBitcoin, richGetRicher}, where they state:

Our analysis begins realizing the Bitcoin transactions can be seen as a Graph. We saw in \ref{sec:bitcoin_transactions}, a Bitcoin transaction is a record of input and outputs addresses, those addresses we translate them into vertices of our Graph. The relation of transferring funds from \textit{Address A} to \textit{Address B} we convert to a directed edge between \textit{Address A} to \textit{Address B}. However,  by design, the Bitcoin protocol allows the outputs section of a transaction be filled out by the user with more than one output. Meaning, a user could transfer to more than one different user on the same transaction. Meaning, the relationship between inputs and outputs of a transaction is \textit{N to M}. For that reason, we can not discover from which input the funds are going exactly to which output. Figure \ref{fig:inputProblem}, visualise this problem. Thus, we applied the same technique proposed on \cite{networkStructureBitcoin, richGetRicher}, where they state:

  A transaction with two inputs and three outputs results in six edges; an edge may appear multiple times, with the corresponding transaction.

In other words, we create an edge for all the possible combinations of inputs to outputs. Figure~\ref{fig:inputProblem} visualizes all the possible inputs and outputs pairs problem.

However, Bitcoin users do not generate a static graph; the same address is allowed to make a transfer again in the future (if there are funds available). Consequently, the Bitcoin graph we are trying to create is not a simple graph, it is a graph that changes over time; one that evolves. Hence we must take into consideration the time. In our case, the time of the transaction that was broadcast on the network.

Hence, our final graph is a list of edges with timestamps. Note that we are not taking into consideration the amount of money transferred from one address to another, our sole interest is on the relationships between the vertices.
